            For the markup, the images inside the component are wrapped inside a <figure> element, which provides a basic skeleton:

    <div class="carousel">
        <figure>
          <span class="item1"></span>
          <span class="item2"></span>
          <span class="item3"></span>
          <span class="item4"></span>
        </figure>
      </div>

            Let's see how far I can go.
